# 🔐 End-to-End Encryption Setup

Your Financify app now supports end-to-end encryption! Here's how to set it up:

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Apply Database Migration
Run the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of apply-encryption-migration.sql
-- into your Supabase SQL Editor and execute it
```

### 2. Enable Encryption
1. **Start your app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Sign in** to your account
3. **Set up encryption**: You'll be prompted to create an encryption password
4. **Save backup codes**: Store them in a safe place!

### 3. Test Encryption
1. **Create a new transaction** after encryption is enabled
2. **Check your database**: The transaction should now be encrypted
3. **Verify**: Raw data should no longer be visible in the database

## 🔍 What You'll See

### Before Encryption:
```sql
-- Raw data visible in database
description: "Coffee purchase"
amount_cents: 25000
is_encrypted: false
```

### After Encryption:
```sql
-- Encrypted data in database
description: null
amount_cents: null
encrypted_data: "[encrypted blob]"
encryption_iv: "[random IV]"
is_encrypted: true
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **AES-256-GCM encryption**: Military-grade encryption
- **PBKDF2 key derivation**: 100,000 iterations for key security
- **Local key storage**: Keys never leave your device
- **Backup codes**: Recovery option if you forget your password
- **Zero-knowledge**: Even we can't see your data

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Password → Key**: Your password is converted to an encryption key
2. **Data Encryption**: All transaction data is encrypted before storage
3. **Local Decryption**: Data is decrypted only on your device
4. **Secure Storage**: Encrypted data is stored in Supabase

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Encryption not working"
- Make sure you applied the database migration
- Check that you set up encryption through the UI
- Verify new transactions are being created (not old ones)

### "Can't unlock encryption"
- Use your backup codes if you forgot your password
- Clear local encryption data and set up again

### "Still seeing raw data"
- Old transactions remain unencrypted (this is normal)
- Only new transactions after encryption setup will be encrypted
- Check the `is_encrypted` column in your database

## 📱 User Experience

- **First time**: Set up encryption password
- **Daily use**: Enter password to unlock (stored locally)
- **Recovery**: Use backup codes if needed
- **Settings**: Manage encryption in Settings → Security & Privacy

Your financial data is now protected with the same level of security as WhatsApp messages! 🎉
